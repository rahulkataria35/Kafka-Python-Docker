# Kafka-Python-Docker

The main objective in this project was to learn how to create an application that sends(Produce) and receives(Consume) a message from Kafka, using Docker and docker-compose tools.

<!-- Let's start with What is Kafka : -->
Kafka is a distributed message streaming platform that uses publish and subscribe mechanism to stream the records.

<!-- the role of Kafka in a microservices architecture. -->

Kafka plays a crucial role in a microservices architecture as it provides a scalable and fault-tolerant messaging system that enables communication between different services. It serves as a distributed streaming platform, allowing the exchange of real-time data streams and event-driven communication among microservices.

# Here are the main roles of Kafka in a microservices architecture:

1. **Event Sourcing and CQRS**: Kafka acts as a log-based message queue where microservices can publish events and other services can consume those events. This facilitates implementing Event Sourcing, a pattern that stores all changes as a sequence of events. It also supports Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), where commands and queries are separated, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

2. **Decoupling and Asynchronous Communication**: Kafka enables asynchronous communication between microservices by providing a durable, reliable, and distributed messaging system. Services can produce messages to Kafka topics without having to worry about the immediate consumer availability. This decouples services, allowing them to evolve independently and providing scalability and fault tolerance.

3. **Real-time Data Processing**: Kafka allows microservices to process real-time streams of data efficiently. Microservices can subscribe to relevant topics and consume data as soon as it becomes available, enabling real-time analytics, monitoring, and other data-driven capabilities.

4. **Fault Tolerance and Scalability**: Kafka provides fault tolerance by replicating messages across multiple brokers, thereby preventing data loss in case of failures. It also allows horizontal scalability by enabling the addition of new brokers to handle increased message throughput. This makes it suitable for highly available and scalable microservices deployments.

5. **Service Integration**: Microservices often need to integrate with various external systems, and Kafka serves as a central data hub that connects services with external systems. Services can consume and produce data from/to Kafka topics, allowing seamless integration with other systems.

Overall, Kafka acts as a flexible and scalable backbone for microservices architecture, facilitating effective inter-service communication, decoupling, event sourcing, real-time data processing, and integration with external systems. It enables a distributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable microservices ecosystem.

# Let's understand the key components of Kafka:

1. **Topics**: It is a category or feed name to which messages are published. Topics are divided into partitions for scalability and performance.

2. **Producers**: Producers are responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. They can be any application or system that generates data.

3. **Consumers**: Consumers read data from Kafka topics. They can be any application or system that processes or analyzes the data.

4. **Brokers**: Kafka brokers are the nodes that form the Kafka cluster. They handle the storage and replication of data across the cluster. Each broker contains one or more topic partitions.

5. **Partitions**: Topics are divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages. Each message within a partition is assigned a unique offset.

6. **Replication**: Kafka uses replication to provide fault tolerance and data durability. Each topic can have multiple replicas across different brokers, ensuring data availability in the event of a broker failure.

7. **ZooKeeper**: Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for coordinating and managing the brokers in a cluster. ZooKeeper helps with leader election, notification of changes, and maintaining cluster metadata.

In a typical setup, producers publish messages to Kafka topics by sending them to Kafka brokers. Brokers store the messages in their assigned partitions and replicate them across the cluster. Consumers subscribe to specific topics and partitions, read messages from the brokers, and process them as needed. ZooKeeper is used to maintain the cluster state and facilitate coordination between the brokers. Overall, Kafka provides a fault-tolerant, distributed, and scalable messaging system for handling high-throughput, real-time data streams.

<!-- Kafka Setup and Configuration: -->

Installing and configuring Kafka on a local machine involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide for installing and configuring Kafka:

1. **Download Kafka**: Start by downloading the Kafka distribution from the Apache Kafka website. Choose a stable release version that is compatible with your operating system.

2. **Extract the Kafka archive**: Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the archive to your preferred location on your local machine. This will create a Kafka directory.

3. **Set environment variables**: To make it easier to run Kafka commands from any directory, you can set up environment variables. Add the Kafka bin directory path to the PATH environment variable.

4. **Configure ZooKeeper**: Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for cluster coordination. Open the Kafka config directory, located in the extracted Kafka directory, and find the *zookeeper.properties* file. Edit this file if necessary to specify the ZooKeeper connection details such as the host and port.

5. **Start ZooKeeper**: Open a new terminal window and navigate to the Kafka directory. Start ZooKeeper by running the following command:

>>> bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

6. **Configure Kafka**: Open the Kafka config directory and find the server.properties file. Edit this file to configure Kafka by specifying various properties such as broker ID, listeners, log directories, etc. Customize these properties according to your requirements.

7. **Start Kafka brokers**: Open a new terminal window and navigate to the Kafka directory. Start the Kafka brokers by running the following command:

>>> bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

8. **Create topics**: Kafka uses topics to organize and store the data. You can create topics by running the following command:

>>> bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test-topic

This command creates a topic named "test-topic" with a replication factor of 1 and a single partition.

9. **Produce and consume messages**: You can now start producing and consuming messages to test your Kafka installation. Open separate terminal windows, navigate to the Kafka directory, and use the following commands:

To produce messages to a topic:
>>> bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic

To consume messages from a topic:
>>>  bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning

This command consumes all messages from the beginning of the topic.

That's it! You have now installed and configured Kafka on your local machine. You can explore more advanced Kafka configurations and features based on your specific use case.


# Now let's understand the purpose of Kafka topics and partitions and how does Kafka ensure fault tolerance through partitions?

The purpose of Kafka topics is to organize and categorize messages or records. Topics act as the central hub for data communication in Kafka. Producers write messages to a specific topic, and consumers read messages from topics of interest to them.

Partitions, on the other hand, are a way to divide a topic into smaller, ordered, and immutable sequences of messages. Each partition is a separate append-only log, and Kafka guarantees that messages within a partition are strictly ordered.

Kafka ensures fault tolerance through partitions by employing a concept called replication. When a topic is created, it can be configured with multiple replicas. Each partition has one leader and one or more follower replicas. The leader replica handles all read and write requests for the partition, while the follower replicas replicate the leader's log. In case of a leader failure, one of the followers is elected as the new leader. This replication mechanism ensures that even if a leader replica fails, the data and processing can continue with the newly elected leader.

The fault tolerance is achieved through the combination of partitioning and replication. By dividing a topic into partitions, Kafka can distribute the load across multiple brokers. Each partition also has multiple replicas spread across different brokers for redundancy. If one broker or replica fails, Kafka seamlessly switches to the replicas, maintaining data availability and ensuring fault tolerance. Additionally, by having replicas, Kafka allows data to be durably stored and prevents data loss in case of unexpected failures.

In summary, Kafka topics and partitions help organize and distribute data efficiently, and fault tolerance is ensured through replication, where multiple replicas of each partition are stored across different brokers.
